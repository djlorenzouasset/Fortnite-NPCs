First Interaction: Yeah, I'm Rust. What's it to you?
Random Dialogue: Shred it.
Random Dialogue: Let's thrash it out.

Random Dialogue: Someday I'm gonna be the lord of this whole wasteland.
Random Dialogue: Megalo Don can't have this Island. It's ours!
Random Dialogue: I consider myself pretty wastelandcore.
Wearing Dummy: So, do you listen to, like... mathcore?


----- NPC: Centurion -----
Default Dialogue: This place is kind of a lot, huh?
First Interaction: Uh. Hey. Hi. I'm Centurion.
Random Dialogue: This place is kind of a lot, huh?
Random Dialogue: Marauders, wastelanders. What about, like, a regular helpful soldier?
Random Dialogue: ATTENTION! No, that was for me, not you. I miss structure.


----- NPC: Cerberus -----
Default Dialogue: I AM THE STRONG HEAD OF CERBERUS. WHAT DO YOU WANT, PUP?
First Interaction: HA HA HA, WHAT WEAKLING CALLS UPON THE HOUNDS OF HADES??
Random Dialogue: I AM THE STRONG HEAD OF CERBERUS. WHAT DO YOU WANT, PUP?

Default Dialogue: *gasp* sorry. Got stuck in the pod flaps. Whaddya want?
Default Dialogue: I don't mind being the middle pea.
Default Dialogue: I'm not the strong foundation, or the face of the business...
Default Dialogue: I'm just me. Earl. How's it goin'?
Default Dialogue: Yeah, I'm the top pea around here.
Default Dialogue: The boys thought I had the right charm to be the face of this operation.

Wearing Hope: Megalo's been askin' about pipeline parts. A LOT. Just FYI.


----- NPC: Oscar -----
Default Dialogue: Hrm. What do you want to know?
Default Dialogue: I didn't grow up a Society brat, like Nisha and Hope.
Default Dialogue: I fought for everything I got. I earned it.
Default Dialogue: First on the streets. Then in the ring. Then in The Society.
Default Dialogue: And whatever comes next, I'll earn that too.
Default Dialogue: We survived the wrath of the gods. Barely.
Default Dialogue: Montague and Valeria both ran off. Good riddance.
Default Dialogue: And Nisha... poor little rich girl will have to build a life for herself, now.
Default Dialogue: There's a brutal poetry to this wasteland. I like it.
First Interaction: If you don't know my name, you're not worth my time.
Random Dialogue: There's a brutal poetry to this wasteland. I like it.
Random Dialogue: The Society was the pointless dream of a feckless thief.
Random Dialogue: I came up from nothing before, and I'll do it again.
Random Dialogue: You want my respect, you had better earn it.
Random Dialogue: The powerful set the terms. The weak accept them.
Wearing Hope: I don't hold a grudge. Anything you can topple doesn't deserve to stand.
Wearing Vengeance Jones: I hear you recovered your precious banana. Don't let him spoil, now.
Wearing Megalo Don: Tiger vs. shark. I have to admit, I'm curious how that bout would go.


----- NPC: Artemis -----
Default Dialogue: Stealth is still not your strong suit, little mouse.
First Interaction: Well met, little mouse.
Wearing Hope: With Zeus humbled, the gods can go our separate ways. I don't mind it.
Wearing Apollo: You should take a vacation, brother. There's nothing like letting loose to calm the spirit.
Wearing Cerberus: Ah, you stayed as well! With your master away, we should have a mighty hunt together.
Random Dialogue: Stealth is still not your strong suit, little mouse.
Random Dialogue: I am enjoying my vacation, now that Zeus' iron grip has relaxed.
Random Dialogue: This wasteland is so... energetic! I appreciate the change of pace.
Random Dialogue: My kin have dispersed, but I... I like this Island, and its chaos.
Random Dialogue: I am getting used to how loud mortals are. I'm even growing fond of it.
Default Dialogue: What are you curious about, little mouse?
Default Dialogue: I honor Zeus as our leader... but I have doubts.
Default Dialogue: His hatred for you mortals is, well, a bit much.
Default Dialogue: And his desire to destroy your kind is dishonorable at its heart.
Default Dialogue: Few things in life are as pure as the Hunt.
Default Dialogue: The chase, the thrill. For both predator and prey.
Default Dialogue: Perhaps I will show you, little mouse. If you can adhere to the rules.


----- NPC: Peelosopher Bananocrates -----
Default Dialogue: NaNa, NaNaNaNaNa Na?
Wearing Peely, Peely Bone, Agent Peely, Unpeely, P33LY, Polar Peely, Toon Peely, KAWSPEELY, Adventure Peely: Well then, seedling, what would you like to know?
Default Dialogue: NaNa Na NaNaNa.
Default Dialogue: NaNa Na, Na Na.
Default Dialogue: Na NaNaNaNa, NaNaNa.
Default Dialogue: NaNaNa NaNa Na.
Default Dialogue: NaNa Na, NaNaNaNa Na.
Default Dialogue: Na, NaNaNaNaNa, NaNa.
Default Dialogue: I understand you meet few of our kin here.
Default Dialogue: It can be very lonely, yes.
Default Dialogue: Know that you can always talk to me when you feel alone, young seedling.
Default Dialogue: True wisdom, seedling, is embracing your limits.

----- NPC: Hope -----
Default Dialogue: If I'm honest, my head's still spinning. But I'll tell you what I know.
Default Dialogue: There's no way my sister could have known that all of this was going to happen...
Default Dialogue: ... But at the same time, she did this. She brought this upon us.
Default Dialogue: I love her. I'm mad at her. She'd BETTER be sorry... (sigh) And I miss her.
Default Dialogue: There's no way a magical water lady saved the Island, okay?
Default Dialogue: I don't know who started that rumor. 
Default Dialogue: And if she's so magical, where's her water now, huh?
Default Dialogue: I used to think the Society was the worst thing there was.
Default Dialogue: Getting attacked by angry gods will change your perspective pretty quickly, though.
Default Dialogue: Don't get me wrong, they're both bad. But I really wasn't a fan of getting electrocuted.
Default Dialogue: I'm gonna keep knocking down these villains until they stop getting up.
First Interaction: Hey. Here we go again, right?
Wearing Vengeance Jones: Sometimes I feel like if I stop being angry, I'll just sit down and stop fighting entirely.
Wearing Valeria: I'm still mad at you... but I also wish you'd just come home.
Wearing Nisha: Now that everything's changed... don't you want to be part of something good?
Wearing Brite Raider, Rust: This wasteland is... a lot. Thanks for having my back.
Random Dialogue: I'm gonna keep knocking down these villains until they stop getting up.
Random Dialogue: I have this sneaking suspicion that there's more going on than we know...
Random Dialogue: Things used to be so simple. But this is better.


----- NPC: Brite Raider -----
Default Dialogue: The world looks brite. And not just because of the constant explosions!
First Interaction: I didn't plan to become a wastelander, but I'm embracing it!
Wearing Brite Bomber: You look so... hydrated!
Wearing Ringmaster Scarr: I'd love to race at the Nitrodrome again! Um, later, I think!
Wearing Valeria: I hope you learned your lesson about opening boxes that don't belong to you.
Wearing Sun Tan Specialist: Please tell me you brought sunscreen.
Random Dialogue: The world looks brite. And not just because of the constant explosions!
Random Dialogue: There's nothing like the acidic burn of Nitro! It's a real acquired taste!
Random Dialogue: Burn brite, wastelander.
Random Dialogue: I hope the llamacorns are staying hydrated.
Default Dialogue: I've got the britest ideas around.
Default Dialogue: That guy seems like a class-A jerk.
Default Dialogue: Hoarding all the nitro for his ship is just wrong!
Default Dialogue: I think I'd like to introduce him to my pal, Bitey...
Default Dialogue: Did Ringmaster Scarr send you?
Default Dialogue: I have no idea how I keep putting up record times at the Drome, okay?!
Default Dialogue: I just sort of... hit the gas, close my eyes, and hope for the best.
Default Dialogue: Well... um... it's everywhere...
Default Dialogue: Not much we can do about it, is there?
Default Dialogue: I just dump out my shoes every couple of feet, and hope for rain!


----- NPC: Vengeance Jones -----
Default Dialogue: Society, down. Zeus, down. Who's NEXT?!
First Interaction: Yeah. You're talking to the unstoppable Vengeance Jones.
Wearing Hope: I'll follow your lead... but we've got this.
Random Dialogue: Society, down. Zeus, down. Who's NEXT?!
Random Dialogue: We took down a god. What chance does Megalo Don stand?
Random Dialogue: Yeah, I'm pretty impressive.
Random Dialogue: I've been told I'm the strong and silent type. I think that's pretty accurate.
Random Dialogue: I could get used to this whole hero thing.
Random Dialogue: You need a brooding, handsome hero of vengeance? I'm your man.


----- NPC: Ruckus -----
Default Dialogue: Want to join Ruckus's Rabbles?
First Interaction: Ruckus is soooo BOOOORED!
Random Dialogue: Want to join Ruckus's Rabbles?
Random Dialogue: You're Ruckus's friend, right? Right??
Random Dialogue: WHEN DO THE EXPLOSIONS START!?
Default Dialogue: What can Ruckus do for wastelander?
Default Dialogue: Megalo Don thinks controlling Nitro means he controls the island.
Default Dialogue: Ruckus knows better. Ruckus knows PEOPLE are more important than Nitro.
Default Dialogue: Without WASTELANDERS, wasteland is just...wasteland.
Default Dialogue: Power Chord and Backbone think Rabbles is a bad name.
Default Dialogue: BUT RABBLES IS A GREAT NAME. THE GREATEST NAME!
Default Dialogue: Rabbles bring peace to wasteland! Rabbles take Nitro from Megalo Don!
Default Dialogue: All Rabbles need is a leader...
