# Fortnite-NPCs
A repository containing all NPCs informations & dialogues from v28.00 (Chapter 5 Season 1). This repository will be updated every Fortnite update.

## Getting Started
All the informations are stored in the [NPCS folder](./NPCS/). Every update has its own folder named with the version of the dump (ex: v28.00, ...).

**In the folders there are 2 files:**
1. `dialogues.txt`: This file contains all dialogues for every NPC with the context (normal dialogue, with a character or first interaction).
2. `raw.json`: This file contains all raw data for every NPC such weapons, dialogues, name, description, services and more.
